1
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,690
She said she's a
prostitute, but I don't do that.

2
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,529
Well, you got to understand
where I'm coming from-

3
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,728
If you could just see
yourself right now.

4
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,326
You look like
you just had a lobotomy.

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,845
What's wrong with you?

6
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,570
This is reality.

7
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,165
Reality? My ass.

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,890
It's all made-up.

9
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,281
Let me ask you this, huh,

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,244
how many times on this show
have you seen the cops

11
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,809
arrest, you know, killers and-and
rapists or something like that?

12
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,486
How many times
did they slap the cuffs

13
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,971
on some crooked CEO fuck?

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,286
What can I get you?

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,361
Beer.
- Beer.

16
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,521
Bottle? Draft?

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,682
Uh, draft.
- Draft.

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,128
What you see is them always
catching drug users and johns,

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,527
you know, people just hurtin',

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,602
just looking for a little
pleasure out of life.

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,806
Three dollars.

22
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,241
What have you got
against cops?

23
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,561
Got nothin' against cops.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,211
Jesus.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,886
I'll tell you
what I got something against.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,964
I got something against stupidity.
Good ol' stupidity.

27
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,929
That's what I got something against.
There you go.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,844
Oh, keep it.
- Oh, thanks.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,126
You comin' or goin'?

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,765
Passing through, kind of.

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,890
I swear to God, a fly can go in your
mouth and you wouldn't even know it.

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,450
You'd just swallow it,
'cause it's, like,

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,124
the only protein
you've ever had.

34
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,128
It's good beer.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,491
Huh?
- Good beer.

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,250
Yeah. Mm.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,970
From Pennsylvania.

38
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,247
So, how long
have you had this place?

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,890
Too long.

40
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,168
It's real homey.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,761
You think so?

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,763
Where the hell do you live?

43
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,081
New Hampshire.
- Portsmouth.

44
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,764
Home of the Navy prison.

45
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,649
Yeah, I know the place.

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,603
You don't remember me, do you?

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,645
Wait a minute.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,681
It can't be.

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,724
Could be.
- No way.

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,889
Way.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,004
Sweet Jesus.
- Doc?

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,287
Wow, "Doc."
Nobody's called me that

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,249
in a long, long time.

54
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,449
Fuck me.
Doc, you made it.

55
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,646
Yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,485
Wow!
Hey, O'Toole, looky here.

57
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,329
He's an old 'Nam buddy of mine.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,004
I saved his life once.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,491
He never saved my life.

60
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,686
Didn't think so.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,531
You got to excuse me, Doc.
Boy, I'm shit for names.

62
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,965
Sheppard.
Larry Sheppard.

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,411
Shep.
That's right.

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,249
19-year-old kid.
Navy corpsman.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,646
Huh?
- Once.

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,484
Yeah, well,
we were all something once.

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,131
Now we're just something else.

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,646
So you do remember me?
Of course I remember you.

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,762
You heard?
I got busted down to E-1.

70
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,484
Yeah. Yeah.

71
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,086
Most unfair. Boy.

72
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,811
The green weenie,
they broke it off in you.

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,921
How long was it?
Was it, like, what, three years?

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,685
Ended up about two
with good behavior.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,730
Oh. Well, see,
that's not so bad.

76
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,723
Well, it was pretty bad.

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,928
Mm.
It was a long time ago.

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,844
Yeah.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,126
BCD?

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,526
Yeah.
- Yeah.

81
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,410
But at some point, instead of
calling it a Bad Conduct Discharge,

82
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,369
I started calling it
a better career decision.

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,602
Fuckin' A.

84
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,721
So, how'd you, uh,
find my lonesome ass?

85
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,450
Oh, it was easy.
The Internet.

86
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,847
You can find anybody
on the Internet these days.

87
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,446
Boy, that is really fucked.

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,406
So, Portsmouth, huh?

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,091
Mm-hmm.
What do you do for a living there?

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm a stocking clerk
at the Navy Exchange.

91
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,768
You got to be shitting me.

92
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,206
That's all right,
that's all right.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,122
Don't you go someplace
when you close?

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,331
Like where?

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,482
I don't know.
- Home?

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,485
It'll be there tomorrow.

97
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,210
Hmm.

98
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,964
Reveille!
Reveille!

99
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,883
Drop your cocks
and grab your socks!

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,809
Reveille!

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,649
Hey. This is
the last slice of pizza.

102
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,721
You want it?
- No.

103
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,842
That's it.
Once this is gone,

104
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,251
there's no more pizza.
- No. Ow.

105
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,762
You sure?
Going once, going twice, gone.

106
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,808
Mmm.
I love cold pizza.

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,651
Hey, you want a beer?

108
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,046
Mm-mm.
- You sure?

109
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,565
Hair of the dog.

110
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,364
Always works for me.

111
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,562
Oh, fuck.

112
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,802
I'm still a little fucked up
from last night,

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,121
if you want to know the truth.

114
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,123
I think I'm getting a little too
old for this shit, frankly.

115
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,568
What's the deal with the grill part
of "Sal's Bar & Grill"?

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,405
Well, gone to rust is the deal.

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,528
That's too bad.

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,968
I guess people just lost their
taste for an honest burger.

119
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,201
Why?
Are you hungry?

120
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,327
No, just curious.

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,209
Hey, you know what,

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,044
we got Mexicans here now,

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,930
so we can get
some chorizo con huevos.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,447
Hey, we qualify for menudo,
if you got the balls for that.

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,931
No, thanks.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,889
You don't want a bite?

127
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,089
There's something I want to show
you, though, if you're up for it.

128
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,731
Mm-hmm.
Sure. I'm always up for it.

129
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,723
You got a car?

130
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,122
Of course I got a car.
I'm a fuckin' businessman.

131
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,966
You want to go now?

132
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,970
Yeah, whenever.
Fuck it.

133
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,728
Oh, I just fuckin' love it,
you know?

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,370
It's priceless.

135
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,362
What is?
- The Navy.

136
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,086
They put the cock to you and then they
let you work at the Navy Exchange.

137
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,084
I got five people
working under me.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,202
You're a fuckin' inspiration.

139
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,760
You know what amazes me
about you?

140
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,763
Could be anything.
I'm a pretty amazing guy.

141
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,483
You turn the keys to your bar over to
the guy who's asleep on your pool table

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
and then you jump in your car and
you drive me to hell and gone

143
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,521
and you don't even know
where we're going.

144
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,126
Well, I didn't think
it would take so fuckin' long.

145
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,242
Take this left up here-

146
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,367
Right here? Mm-hmm.

147
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,811
That's going into a church.

148
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,405
Yep.
Oh, no.

149
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,648
What-what are you doing here?

150
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,802
No, no, no, no-
You're gonna love this, I promise.

151
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,441
I don't know, Doc.
Look, I mean, you seen one, you seen 'en? All, right'?

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,126
No, this is gonna be good.

153
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,522
Geez.
What'd you get me into here, huh?

154
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,807
See, as Christians,
brothers and sisters,

155
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,646
we have choices, hmm?

156
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,009
We can choose
to lay down our will

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,731
and follow God's will.

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,086
That's right.
That's right, Pastor.

159
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,925
The question is,
are you willing to do that?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,085
Oh, my fucking God.
- Not are you ready, but are you willing?

161
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,328
You see, 'cause if you're willing,

162
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,562
if you're willing,
you can trust and believe...

163
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,404
That's him.
I told you you'd like this.

164
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,126
Oh, my God.
- ...that God will take care of the rest.

165
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,929
Yes, Lord.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,526
Yes, He will See, it's a powerful thing...

167
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,931
What's he doing?

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,571
...when you surrender
to God's will...

169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,449
Excuse me, could you
move over for a minute?

170
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,522
...And if fakes ahold of you,

171
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,887
- a powerful thing...
- Powerful!

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,248
When you begin
to take that moment

173
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,845
to look deep inside yourself

174
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,207
and ask the question,

175
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,681
am I willing

176
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,683
to surrender to God's will?

177
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,364
Yes, yes, yes.

178
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,727
Well, you know what they
call that, when God answers?

179
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,201
See, when God answers,
what they call that is

180
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,851
you're having a God moment.

181
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,931
You see, when we stop to ask,

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,401
are my choices,

183
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,211
are they Christ-like choices?

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,721
I mean, this dude

185
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,963
was a first-class drinker,
gambler, cocksman?

186
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,769
Shh.

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,604
Sorry.

188
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,763
Most likely a speed freak, too. I mean,
how did you even find the place?

189
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,081
The Internet.
- The Internet.

190
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,731
Son of a bitch.
...and all of the relationships

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,087
where people are counting

192
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,401
on your Christ-like
character...

193
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,289
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,966
...are trusting
that you will demonstrate

195
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,247
Christ-like integrity.

196
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,004
- Yes.
- Oh, yes!

197
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,248
Amen to that!

198
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,926
Come on. Don't do that.

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,286
I see we have, uh,

200
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,368
some visitors
amongst us here today.

201
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,609
Welcome!
Welcome, brothers, to our Sunday services.

202
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,401
Would you care to stand and
perhaps introduce yourselves?

203
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,563
All right.
- Uh, name is Sal.

204
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,165
Salvatore Nealon.

205
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,162
Uh, USMC, Sergeant, uh, retired.

206
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,766
Uh...
Oh, hey, hey!

207
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,609
Come on. No, come on.
Get up.

208
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,728
Guess who this lad is.
- Huh?

209
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,763
It's Doc.

210
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,161
Huh? Doc.

211
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,765
Also known as Larry Sheppard.

212
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,446
We were in the service together
with your pastor.

213
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,483
Bless my soul.

214
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,881
Praise God!
Welcome, brothers, welcome.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,446
Thank you for joining us
in our fellowship this morning.

216
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,125
Mmm-

217
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,810
Oh.

218
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,564
Oh, man, oh, man.

219
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,808
Southern ham.
- Thank you, ma'am.

220
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,484
All right, so listen up, Ruth,

221
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,848
I'm hoping that this old
man appreciates you.

222
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,530
Oh, I think he does.

223
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,250
'Cause if he ever don't,

224
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,170
you pack your bag
and you come live with Sal.

225
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,926
You don't have a wife?

226
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,610
No, ma'am.

227
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,051
Neither chick nor child.

228
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,162
I do have a lady friend, though.

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,163
But she don't cook worth a damn.

230
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,884
She does have other talents,

231
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,610
if you know what I mean.

232
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,530
Um, well, what about you,
Mr. Sheppard?

233
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,568
Are you single or married?

234
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,883
Oh, I married a wonderful woman,
Mrs. Mueller.

235
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,281
Light of my life, my Mary.

236
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,880
Heart as big as anything.

237
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,281
Real pretty girl.

238
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,691
Great big smile.

239
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,250
Mm. Nice.

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,528
She, um...

241
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,931
she had a little slowness

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,048
because of a thing
when she was born.

243
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,805
Wait, what's that mean?
She's retarded?

244
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,007
No. No.

245
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,090
She could do anything
that anybody else could.

246
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,050
She just was a little delayed.

247
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,202
Huh.

248
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,884
- Great mom, great wife.
- Mm.

249
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,291
Well, what does she do?

250
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,528
Oh, I'm sorry.
She...

251
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,241
Um...
I lost Mary in January

252
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,606
from, uh, breast cancer.

253
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,725
I'm so sorry.

254
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,122
I'm sorry, Doc.

255
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,202
You know me,
I-I don't mean nothin'.

256
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,126
We pay for what
we say, Salvatore.

257
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,568
Yeah?
Well, put it on my tab.

258
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,085
It's okay.
You didn't know.

259
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,970
Your tab's long overdue,
I suspect.

260
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,161
Um, do you, uh,
have any children, Doc?

261
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,011
Um, yes.
Just one, a son.

262
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,650
- Larry Jr.
- Oh.

263
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,690
Well, uh, Richard and I,
we have a girl and a boy.

264
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,131
And we have four grandchildren.

265
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,440
Praise God.

266
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,887
Wait, is it... Richard?

267
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,531
Honey, do we have some coffee
or pie or something

268
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,001
for our guests before we
send them on their way?

269
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,491
Richard.

270
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,005
Oh, yes. Um...

271
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,924
I have a peach cobbler
for dessert.

272
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,691
Ooh!
Peach cobbler!

273
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,610
Now we're livin'!

274
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,286
Huh? Ooh!

275
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,646
All right.

276
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,007
You married up, Richard.

277
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,323
I'm glad to see you prevailing
over your hardships, Doc.

278
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,607
Oh, I-I do my best.

279
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,287
You, at least, seem to have
turned out to be a decent man.

280
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,647
Well, try to be.

281
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,881
And so do I.

282
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,843
Me, too.

283
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,121
I, uh...

284
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,649
I regret any role I played
in all that... foolishness

285
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,370
that happened back in Vietnam.

286
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,682
Oh.
It's okay.

287
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,642
What the hell happened
to Mueller the Mauler?

288
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,324
Huh? I mean...

289
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,448
Well, shit.

290
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,364
What, did you put him in
the Witness Protection Program?

291
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,842
You got him hiding
under the couch or something?

292
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,490
Jesus.

293
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,483
I grew up, Sal.

294
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,683
I found my life's purpose
on the way.

295
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,888
Good for you.

296
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,930
So, what about you?

297
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,167
I always figured you for
a lifer in the Marine Corps.

298
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,208
Is that the way
things shook out?

299
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,609
Yeah.

300
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,126
Yeah, I re-upped.
- Sure.

301
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,403
Expectin ' all the dominoes to fall,
just like they said they would.

302
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,245
I was ready to kill me
some commies in San Diego,

303
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,049
but they never showed up.

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,202
Hey, can you believe this?

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,966
People go to Vietnam
on fuckin' vacation.

306
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,402
Hmm.
- Huh? They pay good money to have their picture taken

307
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,007
where 52,000 young Americans
took their last dump.

308
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,491
Fuck me.

309
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,001
So, you, uh, mustered out
on principle?

310
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,448
I mustered out with a plate in
my head on 100% disability.

311
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,726
And that's the good news.

312
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,485
Boy, I wonder how that happened.

313
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,763
Oh.
Now, that's a good story.

314
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,320
Fuck all if I can remember it.

315
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,569
I believe drink was involved.

316
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,404
Yes, yes.

317
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,562
I'm sure of it'.

318
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,563
Speakin' of drink,

319
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,961
this is the best water
I've ever had.

320
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,162
You see, Ruth, I was on the
shy side of insubordination

321
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,170
most of the time,
but I could get away with it

322
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,204
on account of my dashing
good looks and boyish charm.

323
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,363
I guess we should all be just grateful

324
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,045
that we're still alive.

325
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,281
Amen-
Praise God.

326
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,566
I tell myself that.

327
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,089
Doc, you're not gonna eat that?

328
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,403
Mmm, mmm, mmm. Ooh, God.
I don't want it to go to waste.

329
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,729
You, uh, okay, Doc?

330
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,249
Mm-hmm.

331
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,527
Whatever if is
that's troubling you,

332
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,206
it's probably best to talk about if-

333
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,847
My son...

334
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,971
Because of my son,
I c-came here,

335
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,122
found you guys.

336
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,447
Maybe I shouldn't have.

337
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,289
Your son?

338
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,805
Larry Jr.

339
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,324
A year ago, he joined the corps.

340
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,044
Oorah.

341
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,011
And then two days ago, they came
and told me that he'd been killed.

342
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,200
It was in, uh, Baghdad.

343
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,080
His convoy got ambushed.

344
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,811
They told me that he unloaded
his weapon on them

345
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,928
and he died with his
bayonet in his hand.

346
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,327
Jesus.

347
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,880
He's coming home tonight.

348
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,444
He's gonna be buried
in Arlington.

349
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,205
Full honors.
- A hero.

350
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,164
And I was wondering
if you guys could come with me.

351
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,122
We ask, heavenly Father,
that you continue

352
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,130
to strengthen his spirit
and to soften the sadness

353
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,368
during this-this time
of bereavement-

354
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,885
I can promise you, Doc,
you will meet your wife

355
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,281
and son again,
in a better place.

356
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,930
Oh, come on.

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,729
And all of this will seem

358
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,485
like a momentary separation.

359
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,287
Oh, come on.

360
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,448
What better place
are they going to, huh?

361
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,568
Las Vegas?
Miami Beach?

362
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,723
Uh, Doc knows the place
of which I speak, Sal.

363
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,565
Well, then show him.
He's got a map.

364
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,803
Or maybe he can look it up
on the World Wide Internet, huh?

365
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,527
Well, one only knows it
when one sees it.

366
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,080
And as far
as you are concerned, Sergeant,

367
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,561
it's odds-on that you
shall never, ever see it.

368
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,281
Well, then I guess I'll never miss it.
Oh, you will miss it.

369
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,771
You will miss it dearly,

370
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,844
each and every sweet
moment of eternity.

371
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,088
Do you even know
how long eternity is?

372
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,162
Yeah.

373
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,401
It ain't gonna matter.

374
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,443
Let me ask you something,

375
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,000
with all the billions of people

376
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,122
floatin' around in your heaven,

377
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,686
how come none of them
ever got the word back

378
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,961
to the rest of us?

379
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,281
One of them did.

380
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,171
Oh, right.
That guy. Yeah.

381
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,601
A bit sketchy on the details,
if you ask me.

382
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,330
I'm not asking you.

383
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,210
Okay, Doc, listen up.

384
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,847
I'm really sorry for your loss,

385
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,810
but I ain't gonna blow
a bunch of smoke up your ass.

386
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,966
The worst thing

387
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,168
that can happen to anybody

388
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,043
has landed on you,

389
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,050
and now you just got
to deal with it.

390
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,366
Lord have mercy.

391
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,965
What?

392
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,327
You were a hazard
when you were a younger man.

393
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,528
Now you're just an old fool.

394
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,568
What the hell are you talking...
You know, I...

395
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,041
I got your hazard
dangling here, huh?

396
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,731
I'm going to ask you to watch
your language in my house, sir.

397
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,326
What language is that?
I'm not... Man, listen...

398
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,244
Guys, I didn't want
to cause any trouble.

399
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,530
Okay.

400
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,005
Doc,

401
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,208
I'm gonna help you
bury your boy.

402
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,449
Now, I may not be able
to get you up into heaven,

403
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,966
but I can sure as hell
get you to Arlington.

404
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,922
Mueller?

405
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,004
I certainly would like
to help you, Doc, but I...

406
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,050
But he has to stay here
and pray for you,

407
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,724
which will be very helpful.

408
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,928
- Richard.
- Yes.

409
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,048
Could I see you for a moment?

410
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,286
Of course, dear.

411
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,562
Mueller, please.

412
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,530
I don't get around so well
anymore, as you can see, Doc.

413
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,125
We'll just be in the car.

414
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,329
I know, but...
I don't think so.

415
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,289
No, no, it's impossible.

416
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,282
He is comin' with.
That's affirmative.

417
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,089
No, he said he wasn't going to.

418
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,730
No, don't matter what he said.

419
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,043
I guarantee you
his old lady is shaming him.

420
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,044
Okay?
She's in there right now saying,

421
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,724
"Richard, you have to..."

422
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,326
...go with that poor man.
He needs you.

423
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,920
He will have qualified people
to counsel him at Arlington.

424
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,322
Well, yes, but who will protect
him from that Sal person?

425
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,284
Oh, Lord, that's right.

426
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,322
Shit always goes sideways

427
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,731
when Sal's involved.
- Richard.

428
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,371
What in the world has happened
to your vocabulary?

429
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,965
Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,407
Just kind of slipped out.
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,084
Mm-hmm.

432
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,482
Look, you can't refuse friends
in the time of need.

433
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,170
Friends?
- Mm-hm.

434
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,328
I haven't seen these men
in decades.

435
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,841
You can't refuse anybody.
You're a preacher.

436
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,930
They represent a
dark period in my life, Ruth.

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,445
A very dark period.

438
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,047
And you represent God.

439
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,322
The man lost his son, Richard.

440
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,688
That's all I need to say.

441
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,562
Hey, I'd turn the radio on,
but it's broke.

442
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,248
You got, uh...
A boom box or something?

443
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,646
Want to play...
- No?

444
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,648
Hey, Doc, you can move
your chair back.

445
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,564
You know, separate...
They're individual controls.

446
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,569
Just un-underneath, in the front, there.

447
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,286
Give you some legroom.
Yeah, that's better, right?

448
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,650
So, Richard...

449
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,485
what's the story
with the collar, now, huh?

450
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,961
You got to wear that?
Is it, like, a tracking system

451
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,361
so God knows where you
are at all times?

452
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,808
Do you always have to wear
that thing or can you relax?

453
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,201
I am relaxed.
- Really? All right.

454
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,362
Don't seem that way, but...

455
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,851
if you say so.

456
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,843
I never knew
your name was Richard

457
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,400
in the years
we were together, never.

458
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,522
I mean, if was always Mueller.

459
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,887
Richard. Wow.

460
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,760
When you was a kid,
did you go by "Richie" or "Rich"?

461
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,961
Dick?

462
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,361
You like Dick?
- Hmm?

463
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,887
I just never knew any brothers
named Richard, you know?

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,207
I didn't know
they named 'em that.

465
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,163
Richard Pryor.

466
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,850
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,967
Richard Wright.

468
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,565
Uh...

469
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,846
Mm... Richie Havens.

470
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,160
Oh, oh.

471
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,208
Dick Gregory.
Oh, I stand corrected.

472
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,770
Little Richard.

473
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,282
Now, he likes dick.

474
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,131
Big... big dick... Yeah.

475
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,685
What the fuck?
Look at this guy.

476
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,086
He's on my ass.

477
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,044
Just up on my ass.

478
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,042
Look at this.
- Change lanes.

479
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,327
I'm not gonna change lanes.
This is my lane.

480
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,643
Get the fuck off my ass. Get out of the way.
Just move over.

481
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,563
Come on.
Just get out of the way.

482
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,449
Lei' him by you-

483
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,687
Okay, fuckhead, you want to play?
- Let's play.

484
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,764
What are you doing, Sal? Want to play?
- All right, just hold on, okay?

485
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,604
Trying to have an accident out here?
- Just hold on.

486
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,444
No, I'm gonna jackknife
this motherfucker.

487
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
- Fuckhead.
- What is wrong with you?

488
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,723
You want to play?
- Hey, move over

489
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,562
and let the guy get by!
All right. Shit.

490
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,243
Hey! You trying
to get me killed out here?

491
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,051
Hey, fuck you, asshole!

492
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,963
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

493
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,246
I'm talking to you, jackoff!

494
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,606
You fuckin' asshole!

495
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,011
You fuckin'
get me hurt out here,

496
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,329
I will bury your fuckin' ass
on the side of the road.

497
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,562
All right.
You hear me? You understand?

498
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,086
Keep your eye on the road, man!
- Yes!

499
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,924
Mueller has arrived!

500
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,765
Fuck around, I got a wife and a
congregation to get back to.

501
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,841
Fuckin ' drive, man.

502
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,962
I'm driving, I'm driving.

503
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,242
I thought you was lost forever.

504
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,885
I really did.

505
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,442
Where are we
supposed to go, Doc?

506
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,963
Dover Air Force Base.

507
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,131
That...
that's in fuckin' Delaware.

508
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,202
Right. Dover, Delaware.

509
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,290
So... what are we doing here?

510
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,324
I don't know.

511
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,646
You said Arlington.

512
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,724
Well, yeah, that's what they said.
That's what they told me.

513
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
But now you...
now you're saying Dover.

514
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
Well, I guess...

515
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,685
they have to fly in someplace
first, so they fly into Dover.

516
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,205
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

517
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,850
Okay. No, no.
It's all right.

518
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,371
It's okay.

519
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,726
Dover it is.

520
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,730
Do you want me to drive?

521
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,364
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

522
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,361
Wonder if something's wrong.

523
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,363
Nah.

524
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,647
He's just the guard at a gate.
He don't know nothing.

525
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,127
I wonder if there'll be
an honor guard and all that.

526
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,810
Well, they'll do something.

527
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,604
You know, be respectful,
you know.

528
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,047
But, uh...
just not in public.

529
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,043
'Cause they...
they got a blackout

530
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,963
on all that stuff
this time around.

531
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,371
Yeah, no pictures of coffins.

532
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,891
No reminders to the public.

533
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,009
H's all bullshit'.

534
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,970
The body's in transit-
The plane is due at 0800 tomorrow-

535
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,010
Come back then, you can wait in the hangar.
- Okay, thank you.

536
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,885
Transit.
Everybody's always in transit,

537
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,246
even when you're dead.

538
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,243
Come on, Sal.
It's okay.

539
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,049
Sorry.

540
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,611
How much is it, ma'am?

541
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,609
It's 35, even.

542
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,483
Whoa, Doc.

543
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,130
What's with the wad?

544
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,929
Uh, they took up a collection

545
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,809
at the exchange when they heard.

546
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,971
See?
You got lots of friends.

547
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,963
Well, they felt bad.

548
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,008
They just wanted
to do something.

549
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,969
And here's your key.
- Thank you.

550
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,520
Man, you guys
ain't watching this?

551
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,529
- Watching what?
- Man, they got him!

552
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,641
Who?

553
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,041
Man, that son of a bitch Saddam.

554
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,128
They got him in a spider hole.

555
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,044
Iraqis in Baghdad celebrated,

556
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,366
some with guns...

557
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,005
some with cheers.

558
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,407
The capture of Saddam Hussein

559
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,970
is e defining moment
in the new Iraq-

560
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,169
I expect that the detention
of Saddam Hussein

561
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,844
will be regarded as the
beginning of reconciliation... -

562
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,729
Fuck.

563
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,571
Can't blow smoke rings
for shit now.

564
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,650
Used to be real good at it.

565
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,122
Something happened
with my tongue or something.

566
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,884
We now have final resolution-

567
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,765
Mm. Doc's out.

568
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,888
Look at this fuckin' guy.

569
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,809
Fuck me.

570
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,611
One day he's the head
of a country,

571
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,844
next day he's just some fuck
hiding out in a spider hole,

572
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,886
scared to death.

573
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,400
He... he-he told me
not to worry.

574
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,285
Come here.

575
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,570
He didn't die in vain.

576
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,291
Mr. Sheppard.

577
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,169
Yes.

578
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,124
Mr. Sheppard, I am Colonel Wilits.

579
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,362
Mm.
The President of the United States

580
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,289
has asked me to express
his deep regrets

581
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,807
that your son
was killed in action.

582
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,410
Thank you.

583
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,926
He died a hero
in the service of his country.

584
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,402
He was an inspiration
to his fellow marines.

585
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,089
Can I see him?

586
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,481
Sir, that would be
ill-advised.

587
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,729
Trust me on this, you do not
want to see him like that.

588
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,609
Is it against the rules?

589
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,920
No.

590
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,970
But the lance corporal was hit
in the back of the head.

591
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,247
I assure you he felt no pain.

592
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,086
But the exit wound in such
a case is devastating...

593
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,126
to the face.

594
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,966
They were behind him?
They shot him from behind?

595
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,805
Take the colonel's advice, Doc.

596
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,730
It's best to remember him
as he was.

597
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,285
I'd have to see him.

598
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,362
But that's just me.

599
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,130
The thing is...

600
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,090
you don't have to listen
to no colonels no more.

601
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,646
Those days are gone.

602
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,646
I'd like to...

603
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,163
I'd like to see my son.

604
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,727
Sir, what you will see...

605
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,047
you will not be able to unsee.

606
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,488
I understand-
I just... I feel like I have to-

607
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,164
As you wish, sir.

608
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,127
Lance Corporal Washington,

609
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,481
please escort these two
gentlemen to the coffee mess.

610
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,324
Yes, sir.

611
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,682
Mr. Sheppard,
come with me.

612
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,887
Hey, kid.

613
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,526
Stand at ease, will you?
You're giving me a fuckin' stiff neck.

614
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,365
Man, I never heard anyone
talk to the colonel like that.

615
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,891
Colonels don't scare me.

616
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,247
Never have, never will.

617
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,890
You a marine?

618
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,326
Yeah, I thought so.

619
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,685
I got more time in the chow
line than you got in the corps.

620
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,921
You, too?

621
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,765
Oorah.

622
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,645
Semper fi, do or die.
How you think I got this cane?

623
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,246
Hey, kid.

624
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,288
The fuck's with your ear?

625
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,209
Baghdad boil.

626
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,725
Say what?

627
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,370
Baghdad boil.

628
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,727
Yeah, everybody's got one.

629
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,723
You get bit by a teeny sand fly

630
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,211
over there, and...

631
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,361
Fuckin' Franken-ear.

632
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,766
Jesus.

633
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,490
They say it'll go away...

634
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,489
in a year or two.
- Oh, yeah.

635
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,967
You can count on that.

636
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,526
One fuckin' ugly ear.

637
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,409
This is a big mistake.

638
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,562
Big mistake.
Hey, hey, hold on.

639
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,246
It's not like there's something
you can do about it now.

640
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,243
Unless you're gonna go over there
and just out-tough the colonel.

641
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,243
I don't want nothing.
- All right?

642
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,971
I'm just along for the ride.
Oh, yeah, right.

643
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,929
Fuck.

644
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,401
So you two were in 'Nam
with Larry's dad?

645
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,965
We were.

646
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,963
You guys know what the fuck
happened back then?

647
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,088
Nah. We were just...

648
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,130
pulling triggers, killing gooks.

649
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,841
Larry said his dad wound up
doing brig time behind it.

650
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,366
Yeah, that's all
in the past now.

651
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,608
What do you know about that?

652
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,682
Sounded like he fucked
some dudes up.

653
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,849
Or some dudes fucked him up.

654
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,764
Are you them dudes?

655
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,367
What exactly did
he tell you?

656
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,882
Only that
some bad shit went down-

657
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,644
I was Larry's
best friend, all right?

658
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,764
So no one else knew
anything about it.

659
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,882
So you were with him
during the ambush?

660
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,325
Ambush?

661
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,687
The ambush. The ambush
and the firefight, they said.

662
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,524
Okay-okay?

663
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,568
Okay?
What the fuck is that, okay?

664
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,001
If that's what they're saying it
was, then that's what it was.

665
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,010
Hey.
Come on, you're his friend.

666
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,560
You were there, right?
What happened?

667
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,569
Come on, kid,
don't stonewall us.

668
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,047
He ain't looking at ya.

669
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,327
Come on, it's just us,
marine to marine.

670
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,880
Jarhead to jarhead.

671
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,167
It was fucked.

672
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,169
Me and Sheppard
and three other guys

673
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,844
were all day humping
school supplies

674
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,924
We had tablets,
pencils, new books.

675
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,401
It' was our last' run-

676
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,251
Anyway, we was always stopping
at this little store

677
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,044
we called Abdul's Haji Mart.

678
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,923
We'd have Haji Cokes.

679
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,729
It was my turn to make the run,

680
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,802
but Sheppard said
he'd do it, so he goes

681
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,043
and we're bullshitting
and this raghead comes up,

682
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,724
shouts out...

683
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,441
"Allah Akbar"...

684
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,244
Whatever the fuck.

685
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,448
"God is great."

686
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,528
Puts a cap in Shep's head.

687
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,969
Jesus.

688
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,923
What happened next?

689
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,247
Shit, man, we went off.

690
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,721
Lit 'em all up.

691
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,450
The raghead, Abdul,

692
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,204
damn near whole fuckin' hood.

693
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,446
Carried Larry back
to the Hummer and went home.

694
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,445
You know, the kid's supposed

695
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,443
to get the Bronze Star
behind this.

696
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,090
Yeah.

697
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,605
He'll get the star.

698
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,444
The more stars
the better, right?

699
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,568
Yeah.
- Right.

700
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,121
Okay...

701
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,282
We can '2' tell him about this.

702
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,771
We can't?
- No.

703
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,763
Let him have his Bronze Star.
- Shit.

704
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,844
Let him have his burial at
Arlington with full honors.

705
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,729
Let him have his hero.

706
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,929
Lord knows the man ain't had nothing
but pain in his life lately.

707
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,923
In other words,
let him have the lie.

708
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,368
Think about it, Sal.
What's more important?

709
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,845
I don't know.

710
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,883
But it's never the lie.

711
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,766
Sal...

712
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,041
Sal.

713
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,881
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
always a sound reason

714
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,002
for my recommendations.

715
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,601
Sal, he doesn't have
a face anymore.

716
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,128
You got to be a man now.

717
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,010
Hey, mister.

718
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,525
Hey, Sal.

719
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,921
How did this boy wind up dead?

720
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,365
I beg your pardon?

721
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,841
I think it's
a pretty simple question.

722
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,206
What happened?

723
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,601
The lance corporal
acquitted himself

724
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,041
with dignity and honor,
and he died a hero.

725
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,849
Yeah, but I mean, they're...

726
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,445
they're all heroes, ain't they?

727
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,211
That they are, sir.
Yeah. All heroes.

728
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,362
No question.

729
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,046
How did it happen that this boy

730
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,124
was shot in the back
of the head like a fucking dog?

731
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,090
He was a brave marine,

732
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,242
credit to the corps,

733
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,924
and he served his country well.

734
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,883
Yes, he did.

735
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,241
So did we all.

736
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,765
Every one of us here.

737
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,724
And we'd do it again
if we had the chance.

738
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,127
What's going on, Sal?

739
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,527
I don't know.
That's-that's why I'm asking.

740
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,251
Shouldn't we be making
funeral arrangements?

741
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,044
Isn't that why we're here?

742
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,565
One second.

743
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,041
Now, were you there
when this happened?

744
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,645
No, I wasn't.

745
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,480
So, where were you?

746
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,131
With all due respect, sir,

747
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,282
that is none of your business.

748
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,408
Oh.

749
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,891
Oh, I see.

750
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,247
With all due respect...

751
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,811
Doc ought to be able to talk
to somebody who was there.

752
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,042
You weren't.

753
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,127
All right.

754
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,043
Were you?

755
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,002
Yes, sir, I was there.

756
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,165
Very well.

757
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,170
Lance Corporal Washington,
tell them what happened.

758
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,001
So, where we at
with all of this?

759
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,323
Pretty much
where we were before.

760
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,971
Doc wants his son's face back.

761
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,401
Can't blame him for that.

762
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,727
Called my wife.

763
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,371
I'm going home.

764
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,681
I'll be taking the bus.

765
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,206
So you're quittin'?

766
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,282
Quittin' what?

767
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,443
Why don't we find out?

768
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,001
So, Doc, what, uh,

769
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,447
what are we gonna do here?

770
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,406
I can't bury him at Arlington.
Not now.

771
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,611
He qualifies and he deserves that honor.
Here.

772
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,523
This is what he looked like.

773
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,204
Can I see it?

774
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,926
Handsome boy.
Wow. Yeah.

775
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,566
High school girls
were crazy about him.

776
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,451
My handsome boy.

777
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,608
I'm taking Larry home.

778
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,371
Sir, I can assure you
that is a bad decision

779
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,887
and you will come to regret it.

780
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,530
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

781
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,523
Please stop.
- Sir, sir.

782
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,444
The marines will transport
the body for you,

783
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,769
at no cost to you,
anywhere you choose.

784
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,205
Sir, sir...

785
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,408
Sir, stop.

786
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,806
I cannot legally release
the lance corporal's body

787
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,928
to anyone,
except a licensed mortician.

788
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,123
Or a clergyman.

789
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,360
Isn't that so, Colonel?

790
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,801
Correct.

791
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,321
Well...

792
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,561
it looks like...

793
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,323
...that will be me.

794
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,884
Lads.

795
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,286
Here we go.

796
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,210
Yeah. There.

797
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,531
Not gonna fit.

798
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,004
How you gonna get him home now?

799
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,283
What you gonna do,
Sal, strap the coffin to the roof of your car?

800
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,645
We could do that.

801
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,530
Just need a little help
lifting it up, huh?

802
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,807
Maybe we can get that kid
with the fucked-up ear.

803
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,961
Don't be ridiculous.

804
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,201
Why not?

805
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,810
You know a better way to be?

806
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,963
You wish you could be ridiculous,
but it's too late now.

807
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,283
Doc, you've got to let the
government transport the body.

808
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,169
I mean, it's the kind of thing
they're good at.

809
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,208
L-I don't like
the government right now.

810
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,810
Well, you don't have to.

811
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,291
I don't trust it anymore.

812
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,165
Hey, you know what,
we could rent a truck.

813
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,965
You know what, let's do that.
Uh, you take the car.

814
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,008
We'll stay here.

815
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,525
Go find a truck.
- All right.

816
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,325
And pay for it out of that.
One truck, comin' up.

817
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,802
I'm coming with you, Sal.
You can drop me at the bus station.

818
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,690
I think I got to be getting
back home now, Doc.

819
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,004
I understand, Mueller.
I'm sorry I dragged you all the way up here.

820
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,321
I really thought I could be
of some help to you, you know.

821
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,482
I mean, I thought
we were going to a funeral.

822
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,326
We are going to a funeral. Just looks like
it's gonna take a little longer to get there.

823
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,004
It's okay.

824
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,163
I'm just glad I got a chance
to... see you again.

825
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,841
I'm very happy
I got to see you again, Doc.

826
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:19,161
God bless you, Doc.

827
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,203
Keep you in my prayers.

828
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,691
And bless you, too, lad.

829
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,369
Let me ask you something,

830
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,602
man-to-man, hmm?

831
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,882
You ever wonder...

832
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,601
what would've happened,
way back then, if we hadn't...

833
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,445
Doc wouldn't have ended up doing two
years in the brig, that's for sure.

834
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,168
And you and me,
we... wouldn't had to seen what we did.

835
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,486
And what was that?

836
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,484
Are you shittin' me?

837
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,925
You tellin' me you don't remember?

838
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,002
I remember a lot of shit.

839
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,288
What are you talking about?

840
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,601
A certain platoon buddy
getting shot,

841
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,968
writhing around
on the ground dying,

842
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,281
with nothing to give him
to ease his pain

843
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,488
'cause we had already taken
all the morphine.

844
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,490
God rest his soul.

845
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,927
There wasn't nothin'
we could do at that point.

846
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,526
And we did nothin'.

847
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,167
And sometimes
you got to do a little more.

848
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,482
I have a van
that would work for you.

849
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,961
All right.
But I think you might be happier

850
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,327
with a truck that's got
a hydraulic tail lift.

851
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,845
Oh.

852
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,843
Hydraulic lift.
I like that, huh?

853
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,809
What will you be hauling?

854
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,282
Oh, you know, a truck
with a lift will handle it.

855
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,330
Will you be dropping it off back here
or at another location?

856
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,970
Uh...

857
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,122
Don't you know?

858
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,806
No, I guess
I'll be dropping it off here.

859
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,166
And when will that be?

860
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,650
What you lookin' at me for?

861
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,963
I don't know.
How many days would it...?

862
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,122
You don't know how long
you're going to need it?

863
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,891
No, I don't know how long I'll need it.
Give me a week.

864
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,490
Oh, yeah.

865
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,005
A week, he says.

866
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,681
Mueller, come on.
It's out of your hands, all right?

867
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,802
Why don't you sit down,
take a load off,

868
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,360
and let the mountain come
to Muhammad, all right?

869
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,085
Chill.
All right?

870
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,482
I need to see your driver's license.
- Yeah.

871
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,243
Here you go.

872
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,767
Ooh.

873
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,530
These are free, right?

874
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,011
Norfolk, Virginia?

875
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,320
Yeah.

876
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,680
Got to live somewhere.

877
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,086
Will you be the only driver?

878
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,362
Uh, no, no, I'll have some help.

879
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,046
Then I'll need to see
the other driver's license.

880
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,726
- Is it this gentleman here?
- ... thy rod

881
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,247
and thy staff, they comfort me.
- His holiness?

882
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:16,689
No, no.
His holiness can hardly walk,

883
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,923
let alone handle a big rig
with a hydraulic lift.

884
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,570
Whoever...
I'll need their license.

885
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,244
...I will dwell
in the house of the Lord.

886
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,448
What are you doing, with the bouncing?
What is that?

887
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,164
I'm speaking a psalm.

888
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,526
A psalm?
- Mm.

889
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,204
Oh.

890
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,763
As in, a psalm-a bin Laden.

891
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,241
So, you are the only driver?

892
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,243
Yes, ma'am, I be the wheelman.

893
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,811
How will you be paying?

894
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,322
Oh. Okay.

895
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,323
Take it out of this.

896
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,481
♪ That's the jingle bell ♪

897
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,206
♪ That's the jingle bell rock ♪

898
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,169
16 to 60,

899
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,204
you put a dude behind the wheel
of a big rig like this,

900
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,486
you're gonna feel like hot shit.

901
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,002
This is a rented U-Haul
with an automatic transmission.

902
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,242
This is bigger than anything
you ever handled.

903
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,084
Sal, Doc's boy is dead.

904
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,571
Try not to forget that.

905
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,411
I haven't forgotten that.

906
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,403
Jesus.

907
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,801
But we're still alive, right?
Praise God.

908
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,247
With time ticking fast away.

909
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,608
So if there's one minute that's not too
terrible, I'd like to try to enjoy it.

910
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,920
All right.

911
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,082
I mean, you used to be
up for some fun.

912
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,650
I still am.
- Oh, yeah.

913
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,404
As long as it's right
in God's eyes.

914
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,482
What is that, "God's eyes"?

915
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,721
Wha-What...
God don't have any eyes.

916
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,604
Oh, yes, He does.

917
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,808
Oh, yeah.
God has eyes and He has ears.

918
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,370
Yeah.
And He hears every insult

919
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,050
- that you send His way.
- Geez.

920
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,243
You believe me when I tell you, Sergeant,
there will be a reckoning.

921
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,685
Oh, a reckoning.

922
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:46,365
Yeah, God as my witness.
All right.

923
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,811
I can assure you of that.

924
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,848
Well, great, then,
because I reckon

925
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,723
that I would take
that opportunity

926
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,002
to stand at attention
and say to God,

927
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,050
"Hey! Where were You when the...

928
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,289
"raping children and the-the
genocide and all that?

929
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,681
"Where were You
when they flew airplanes

930
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,526
"into the buildings and killed thousands of people
"who were just going to work?

931
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,841
"Where were You when Doc's kid

932
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,486
"was just buying Cokes
for his buddies

933
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,370
"and some raghead come up
and shoot his face off?

934
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,851
Huh?
Where were You?"

935
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,651
Yeah, you see,
I'm not gonna stand there

936
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,688
and try to explain myself
to Him,

937
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,728
I'm gonna make God
explain Himself to me.

938
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,525
Oh, all right.
Yeah, and I think by the end of it, He'll say,

939
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,208
"Hey, come on. Get in here.

940
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,886
"You?
You're my kind of dude.

941
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,088
You, give me one of these."

942
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,165
All right, well,
good luck with that.

943
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,844
I'll be praying for you,
you hear?

944
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,208
Yeah, well, I'll be hoping
for the same thing.

945
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,760
But, boy,
if it's a tight-ass God,

946
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,928
then I am fucked.
- Yeah.

947
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,010
And I think it's time for that lube
job on that plate in your head.

948
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,367
Hey, stay the fuck away
from my plate, all right?

949
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,283
I'm picking up WOR from New York.

950
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,004
I'm homesick.

951
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,566
Yeah.
- Hey, wait a minute. Maybe...

952
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,884
Oh, no, no, no.
Well...

953
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,043
You have to turn that shit off.
- So, you know about this stuff, right?

954
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,610
Oh, man.
- All right.

955
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,327
So, you know, I have been known
to get in a face or two.

956
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,721
But even I'm offended
by this stuff.

957
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,404
I mean,
it's damn hard to dance to.

958
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,201
Well, that is one thing that we can finally agree on.
- There you go.

959
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,205
Aren't you a little ashamed
being an African-American?

960
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,726
Mm, no, not really.
Why should I be?

961
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,202
Because being a dignified
gentleman such as yourself,

962
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,328
you would be the first to agree

963
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,729
that this is so far away
from, like, Motown, man.

964
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,802
Right? Well, I have

what your kid would have wanted.

1053
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,963

Um... to chase girls.

1055
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,002
He was only 21.

1056

Yeah.

1058
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,728
You know, Doc, you can make this
a whole lot easier on yourself.

1059
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,805
Yeah, I don't want
to make it easy on myself.

1060
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,008
Yeah, you're right.

The worst has happened,
like we knew it would.

1065
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,600
They sent him off
to a godforsaken desert.

1066
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,245
Why?

1067

1068
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,766
It wasn't to protect America.

1069
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,686
It's like that jungle
they sent us to.

1070

It was no threat to us.

1071
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,810
And then they send him
back to me in this,

1082

minding my business,

1088

- reading the Scriptures.
- The Bible.

1089

and what do you want from me?

1091
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,926
That depends.

1092

Hold if right there.

1096
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,807
It used to mean something,
you know?

1097
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,360
Esprit de corps.

1098
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,201
A unify.

1099
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,807
Some... well-earned pride
and some goddamn common sense.

1100
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,723
I don't even know
what it means anymore.

1101
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,365
You know what?
Fuck them.

1102
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,044
Yeah. Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em all.

1103

Fuck 'em all, is right.

1104

Your best years
are still ahead of you, Sal.

1106

Oh, fuck off.
- No, it's true.

1107
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,249
Look at me, Doc, all right?

1108
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,089
My future is behind me.

1109
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,925
I got a scrambled brain held
together with a steel plate.

1110
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,685
They look at me and what do they see?
A fuckin' terrorist.

1111
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,762
An apology would have been nice.

1112
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,406
Yeah.
They're sorry, all right.

1113
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,086
They're sorry
they didn't smoke our asses.

1114
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,489
Don't get it.

1115
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,445
Doc.

1116
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,723
Aw, shit.

1117
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,689
What, did you forget
your toothbrush?

1118
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,128
Jesus.

1119
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,529
I had to call my wife

1120
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,450
from the police station.

1121
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,648
You hear me?

1122
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,081
From the police station!

1123
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,730
All right.

1124
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,451
What happened?

1125
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,930
After they ID'd me as
the Reverend Richard Mueller,

1126
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,243
found that I am not a Muslim
radical, nor am I a mullah.

1127
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:05,288
Mullah the Mauler!
- Huh?

1128
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,761
Oh, fuck, it's all over,
isn't it?

1129
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,251
The country's fucked.

1130
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,290
Was Ruth upset?
Oh, she was very upset.

1131
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,089
Wanted me to come home
right away,

1132
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,924
but I said no, no,
no, no, no, honey.

1133
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,322
There are times that demand
that even old men

1134
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,481
should become threats.

1135
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,762
Fuckin' A right.
It's like during the pinko scare...

1136
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,330
I thought I was talking.

1137
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,129
Yeah, you were.

1138
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,646
I told my wife
lam not coming home!

1139
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,848
Not until we're done here.

1140
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,921
Where's your boy?

1141
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,809
They got him again.

1142
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,770
Tomorrow we gonna get him back.

1143
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,569
And then we're gonna
take him home.

1144
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,164
Ten-hut!

1145
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,645
Gentlemen, good morning.

1146
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,121
So, Colonel
whatever your name is,

1147
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,770
where's Larry?

1148
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,491
Wilits.
It's Colonel Wilits.

1149
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,971
Oh.

1150
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,566
I've been briefed
on yesterday's snafu.

1151
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,005
Completely ridiculous.

1152
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,323
Apparently, the U-Haul agent
went off the deep end.

1153
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,046
But there it is,
and what's done is done.

1154
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,201
I hope that, given further
time for reflection,

1155
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,487
you can see that Arlington
is a resting place

1156
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,483
that should not be refused
in anger.

1157
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,401
There lie heroes, sir.

1158
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,249
The details
of the lance corporal's death

1159
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,169
are what they are,
but make no mistake,

1160
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,844
his death was heroic.

1161
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,366
He was in a foreign
and hostile land

1162
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,761
doing the decent thing.

1163
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:46,481
He deserves to lie beneath
the sacred soil of Arlington.

1164
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,446
He would want that, and I urge
you to choose that for him.

1165
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:55,446
Thank you. I'm going to take my son
home and bury him in New Hampshire.

1166
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,005
And not in his uniform.

1167
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,367
I'm gonna bury him
in his graduation suit.

1168
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,724
As you wish.

1169
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,122
Your government will fly
the coffin, at no cost to you,

1170
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,767
to Portsmouth, and to a funeral
director of your choosing.

1171
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,121
No. We're taking him
with us today.

1172
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,083
With all due respect, sir,

1173
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,322
you're cutting off your nose
to spite your face.

1174
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,210
Hey. Colonel.

1175
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,088
Did you look at these faces?

1176
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,730
They've already been spited,

1177
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,770
so why should we give a fuck
about your opinions?

1178
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,525
With all due respect.

1179
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,204
We're gonna take the train.

1180
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,484
Okay. I'll make
the arrangements.

1181
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,130
Lance Corporal Washington here
will be going with you.

1182
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,248
This is Wilits.

1183
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,243
I need you to make
some things happen ASAP.

1184
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,607
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Wilits.
- Stand by.

1185
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,931
We don't need no babysitter.

1186
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,724
I wasn't implying that you did.

1187
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,121
Washington is on TDY escort duty.

1188
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,283
You don't want him,
he goes right back to Baghdad.

1189
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,481
Guys?

1190
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,847
We could use the help.

1191
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,244
Does he pull per Diem?

1192
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,401
Of course.

1193
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,528
Then fall in, Washington.

1194
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,244
But he takes orders from us.

1195
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,642
He takes his orders...
from me.

1196
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,645
But he will accommodate you
in any reasonable way you ask,

1197
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,370
because I just ordered him to.

1198
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,766
Is that clear?

1199
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,286
Very clear.

1200
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,203
Colonel.

1201
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,368
Boy...

1202
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,962
you are a fuckin' force
of nature, huh?

1203
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,844
Man, I would've loved
to run into you in the field

1204
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,524
in my younger days.

1205
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:43,285
You really think so?

1206
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,805
Oh, yeah.

1207
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:47,167
'Cause one of us
would have been fragged.

1208
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,766
And the other
would've gone to the brig.

1209
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,801
Halt.

1210
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,044
Down.

1211
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,087
Ready.

1212
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,089
Face.

1213
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,362
I don't give a fuck
what they say.

1214
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,602
You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

1215
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,165
The lance corporal is ours.

1216
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,328
He's a marine
until he goes into the ground,

1217
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,767
and remains a marine the period
of time he's underground

1218
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,201
plus 100 years, is that clear?

1219
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,850
Yes, sir.
I will not have

1220
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,049
three over-the-hill veterans
pissing on my corps.

1221
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,246
Understood?
- Yes, sir!

1222
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,483
You're a marine. Your mission
is to see your brother home.

1223
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,291
You're in charge, and when
in charge, you take charge!

1224
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,805
Understood?
- Yes, sir!

1225
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,247
There'll be a Mortuary Affairs
detail every step of the way.

1226
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,051
You will protect the dignity
of that dead marine,

1227
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,600
and you will see to it
that he is buried with honors

1228
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,047
in his uniform,
not some cocksucking,

1229
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,205
motherfucking pussy
civilian graduation suit!

1230
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,248
Clear?
- Yes, sir!

1231
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:26,569
And don't let that Sal fucktard
outflank you.

1232
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,041
He's old but he's dangerous.
Do not let that happen.

1233
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,610
Kill him first.
- Sir?

1234
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,803
That is not an order.
- Yes, sir!

1235
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,810
And just because that
crippled preacher reminds you

1236
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,723
of your father, don't trust him.

1237
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,643
I never knew my father, sir.

1238
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:45,449
Lance Corporal, do you have some kind of personal problem?
- No, sir.

1239
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:46,885
Then get on it!
- Yes, sir!

1240
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,321
Ready.
- Hut!

1241
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,405
Ready... face!

1242
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,003
Forward march!

1243
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,284
Well, Washington says
you served.

1244
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,488
Yeah. Army.
- Oh, really? Yeah? Yeah.

1245
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,324
Did you see some shit?

1246
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,926
Yeah, I was there the first time.
Gulf War.

1247
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,764
Right, right.

1248
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,444
You came back.

1249
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,444
Yes. Yeah,
and I'm not pissing blood.

1250
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,364
My babies are all okay.
Hey, that's good.

1251
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,010
John Redman.
- Larry Sheppard.

1252
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:33,526
Don't worry, I'll...
I'll look after your boy.

1253
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,966
Thank you.

1254
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,206
Whenever you're ready.

1255
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,491
Okay.

1256
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,564
Hey, at ease, Washington.
- Huh?

1257
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,163
I got a question for you.

1258
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,321
When did you get so old, hmm?

1259
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:23,165
I think it was
over the last 30 years.

1260
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,605
Same as you.

1261
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,210
Me? No.

1262
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,520
Categorically deny it.

1263
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,204
Deny if all you want-

1264
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,881
It will not stop the clock,
nor will it turn back time.

1265
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:39,523
So, what do you think
of that grunt, Washington, huh?

1266
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,523
What about him?
- I don't know.

1267
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,364
He don't say much.

1268
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:44,965
Him and his Baghdad boil,

1269
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,082
boy, that's
some gnarly shit, right?

1270
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,525
Well, what do you want
to know about him?

1271
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:50,204
I don't want
to know nothin' about him.

1272
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,691
Sounds like he's an individual

1273
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,290
who's heavy
on your mind, though.

1274
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,801
Ain't nothin' heavy on my mind.

1275
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,086
Just wondering.

1276
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,403
Then go back and talk to him,
if he's such a mystery to you.

1277
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,927
Everything is a mystery to me.

1278
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,928
Except you.

1279
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,042
Please.

1280
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,927
I think I'll go back
and talk to him.

1281
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,968
Oh, I'm sure he'll enjoy that.

1282
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,611
Tell him he should come
up here and sit with us.

1283
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:22,761
All right.

1284
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,127
I'll extend an invitation.

1285
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,847
There we go.

1286
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,562
This is bleak, man.

1287
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,482
You're welcome.
- What for?

1288
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:52,168
What for?
Are you on a train in Baghdad?

1289
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,686
No, you are not.
- I guess not.

1290
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,649
Yeah, TDY.

1291
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,643
Sometimes it's fun.

1292
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,644
Sometimes it's a bitch.
No, I don't mind.

1293
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,007
He was my best friend.

1294
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:10,045
Yeah, you didn't, uh, what,
hang with the brothers?

1295
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,770
What the fuck is that?

1296
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,611
I don't know.
I saw it on the MTV, I think.

1297
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,125
It's not a rule.

1298
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,009
No, I'm not saying it's a rule.

1299
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,804
I liked the dude.

1300
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,281
He had my back and I had his.

1301
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:24,966
He was honest,
said what he thought.

1302
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:26,963
Oh, yeah.
Simple, in a good way.

1303
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,326
Never had an attitude.

1304
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,368
Sounds a lot like his father.

1305
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,124
Even the honest part?

1306
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,486
Doc?

1307
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,085
Doc is not a dishonest man.

1308
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,491
What about the brig time?

1309
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,562
Fuck, that could've happened
to any one of us.

1310
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,284
No, he got fucked.

1311
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,408
Doc was a lot younger than us.

1312
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,170
He was a kid.

1313
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,403
And technically,
he was in the Navy.

1314
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:51,205
Eh.
He wanted to be our friend,

1315
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,602
and... we took advantage of it.

1316
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,843
I mean, we had done him a favor,

1317
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,321
and he was doing a favor
for us, and then...

1318
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,166
all this shit went down, and
someone had to take the fall.

1319
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,004
It was Doc.

1320
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,208
Hey,

1321
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:11,682
Look, why don't you come up
with us for a while, huh?

1322
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,127
Redman will look after your buddy. Won't you?
- It's no problem.

1323
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,407
That's all right.
- Thank you.

1324
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,369
Geez, come on,
you got to get out of here.

1325
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,681
It's colder than Eskimo pussy.

1326
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,842
I don't mind.
Really.

1327
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,285
Look“.

1328
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,324
I want you to come up and talk
to Larry's father, huh?

1329
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,050
Say something nice.

1330
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,691
I don't know what I would say.

1331
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,610
You'll think of something.

1332
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:38,007
Come on.

1333
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,091
Boy, oh, boy, look at them-

1334
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,731
Who?
Geez.

1335
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:48,451
And all the shit they bought.

1336
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,080
Boy, they don't have a clue.
They're just regular people

1337
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,208
out doing their
Christmas shopping, Sal.

1338
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,567
Fuckin' sheep is what they are.

1339
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,126
I wouldn't mind
being one of them.

1340
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,730
Yeah.

1341
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,131
It's better than being shot at.

1342
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,123
I'd rather be fighting them
over there

1343
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,725
than in our own backyard.

1344
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:06,131
Sound familiar?

1345
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,202
Oh, yeah.

1346
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,726
See, we fought the commies
in 'Nam so we wouldn't have

1347
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,484
to fight 'em
on the beaches of Malibu.

1348
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,528
Guess it worked.

1349
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:20,082
I... I guess it did.

1350
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,322
Yeah, 'cause, uh...

1351
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:25,091
marines got to be willing
to die on order, so...

1352
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,686
Semper fi.
Do or die.

1353
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,770
Yeah, that's always been
the mission, right?

1354
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,241
It's a bunch of crap.

1355
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,924
Course, you got to have a reason

1356
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,321
to want to even get in a fight
in the first place.

1357
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,926
So what are they telling us
it is this time? Huh?

1358
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,968
That we're in imminent danger.

1359
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,283
That they're stockpiling
weapons of mass destruction.

1360
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:48,170
A possible mushroom cloud.

1361
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,447
It's just lies.
It's the same old shit.

1362
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,965
You know, stay the course.

1363
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,764
If we pull out now,

1364
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,650
then all our heroes
will have died in vain.

1365
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,768
You know, blah, blah, blah.

1366
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,962
You know, you'd like
to have a little faith

1367
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,280
in your leaders
and your country.

1368
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:06,126
I mean, I love this country, I think we're
a good country. Aren't we a good country?

1369
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,123
We are a good country, but...

1370
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,680
if you catch your government
lying to you,

1371
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,286
if changes everything, doesn't it?

1372
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,805
Yeah.

1373
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,326
So, kid, how's the living
over there? Hmm?

1374
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,647
It's all right.
- Yeah?

1375
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:22,166
But they sure fuckin' hate us
over there.

1376
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,244
Sound familiar?

1377
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,971
I swear to God, we got to be
the only occupying force

1378
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,247
in history
that expects them to like us.

1379
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,330
When you go out, you just
never know what to expect.

1380
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,641
But... being from Oakland,

1381
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:38,041
I'm used to people dying
all of a sudden.

1382
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:39,929
Geez.
Really?

1383
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:44,651
In high school, one of my best
friends was shot by a stray bullet.

1384
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,082
My father, robbed on the street,

1385
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:49,929
and they put one in him.

1386
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:53,010
I didn't even know who he was
until he turned up dead.

1387
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,003
- Jesus, kid-
- MUELLER: Lord have mercy.

1388
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,411
I'm only sayin'.

1389
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,090
So, what, you joined the Marines

1390
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,202
to get away
from all that in Oakland?

1391
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,080
No. I didn't have
much else to do, so...

1392
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,966
uh... you know, I wanted
to strengthen my character.

1393
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,371
It was that way with Larry, too.

1394
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,681
You know,
we wanted to test ourselves.

1395
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,842
Yeah, boy, we felt
the same thing-

1396
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:15,684
Mm-hmm.

1397
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,161
Every generation has their war.

1398
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,246
Men make the wars,
and wars make the men.

1399
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,049
Never ends.

1400
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,603
Maybe one day
we'll try something different.

1401
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,927
When he was little, Larry used to
like to play with toy soldiers.

1402
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,561
Dig trenches for 'em,
put 'em through basic training.

1403
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,971
Mm-hmm.

1404
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,724
Mr. Sheppard, Larry was
where he wanted to be.

1405
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,290
He hated it.

1406
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,044
We all hate it.

1407
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,963
But you get sent over there,

1408
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,242
and it stops being
about what you want,

1409
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,731
or the war, even,

1410
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,802
and you're there
for your brothers.

1411
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,888
That's all that really matters.

1412
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,723
He must have been embarrassed,

1413
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,724
me sitting out the last part
of our war in the brig.

1414
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,002
No, sir.

1415
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,248
He wasn't embarrassed at all.

1416
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:16,009
Thing that made Larry different
from the rest of us in the unit,

1417
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,009
he had a happy childhood.

1418
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,924
He said that?
- Yes, sir.

1419
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,447
He had a mother and father that
loved him, loved each other.

1420
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,649
And... nice house to live in,

1421
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,644
good food to eat,
and he went on about school

1422
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:34,042
and football and...
nice friends.

1423
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,610
And he loved you.

1424
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,049
Mm-hmm.

1425
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,969
Mr. Sheppard, it was my turn
to get the Cokes.

1426
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,805
That was my bullet, not Larry's.

1427
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,166
Mm-mm. No.

1428
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,651
No, no, no.

1429
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,766
A gray car pulled up
in front of the house.

1430
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:12,490
Marine lieutenant,
Navy chaplain...

1431
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,810
shiny brass belt buckles.

1432
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,406
I kept staring
at those shiny buckles.

1433
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,370
"The president has asked me
to express his deep regret."

1434
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:27,164
Killed in action.

1435
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,969
In action.

1436
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:36,088
Nothing about shot in the back of the
head getting Cokes for his buddies.

1437
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,244
Nothing about...

1438
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:41,891
killed while...

1439
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,763
delivering supplies
to the Baghdad school system.

1440
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,600
There we go.

1441
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,602
There... we go.

1442
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,449
Ah-ha.

1443
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,730
Hmm? Thirsty?

1444
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,406
That went down awfully quick.

1445
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,721
Yeah, well, I'm drinking for two

1446
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:39,882
now that you got
all old and boring.

1447
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,644
It might be
that you're an alcoholic.

1448
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,569
You think?

1449
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,165
Well, I am.

1450
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,123
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1451
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,283
But I recognized it, see?

1452
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,527
Took ownership of it.

1453
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,931
That was the first step.

1454
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,445
Mm-hmm.

1455
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,326
Why don't you take ownership
of this beer?

1456
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:03,129
Huh?
Come on. Don't...

1457
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,771
Well, I'm...
I'm very good right now.

1458
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,047
With this coffee, I'm fine.

1459
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,489
Hey, at least
we're not drug addicts.

1460
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,924
Thank... God.

1461
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,490
Not anymore.

1462
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:18,085
"Not anymore."

1463
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,770
We never were.

1464
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,922
We took the shit, Sal.

1465
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,526
Yeah.
'Cause we needed the shit.

1466
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,642
No.
We needed it,

1467
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,563
the corps
would've issued it to us.

1468
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,962
Yeah.
In a way, they did.

1469
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,963
That shit was meant for pain.

1470
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:35,326
All drugs are.

1471
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,448
So? What's wrong
with taking it, then?

1472
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:40,364
Morphine... is addictive.

1473
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,124
Yeah, so is pain.

1474
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,170
We weren't the ones
who were in pain, though.

1475
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,322
The fuck we weren't.

1476
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:51,971
Different kind of pain.

1477
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,402
Pain is pain.

1478
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:03,330
When we get to the next stop,
I got to call Ruth.

1479
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,849
You know what you need?

1480
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,207
You need one of those
mobile telephones.

1481
01:16:10,280 --> 01:16:12,647
You could be talking
to Ruth right now.

1482
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:15,246
Even on this train, you could be talking.
- Say what?

1483
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:19,523
Yeah, I mean,
every ten-year-old has them.

1484
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:22,404
They practically stopped
making pay phones.

1485
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:45,685
So-so,
we ended up at Disneyland

1486
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,684
to resuscitate Doc,
who is metaphorically drowning.

1487
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,524
Geez, I got your metaphoricals
right here.

1488
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,206
- Stick to the story. Come on.
- Wait, hold on. Let me, let me follow.

1489
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,726
So there's a Disneyland
in Vietnam?

1490
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,363
Well, yes, young blood.

1491
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,649
That's what they call
the whorehouses and the bars

1492
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,285
that spring up around the base.

1493
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,926
And it was the company
fucking commander's doing.

1494
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,729
You see, he was
the one who told us,

1495
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,609
"Hey, you need
to take a few days off

1496
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,250
"and get Doc's ass to Disneyland

1497
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,089
before he has a total meltdown."

1498
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,889
I was having some problems.

1499
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:21,883
Yeah, you sure as shit were.

1500
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,042
And the number one problem
he was having is that

1501
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,929
it was time for him
to get his cherry busted.

1502
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,809
Oh.
So... yes.

1503
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,251
Hey, Washington, before you...

1504
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,243
how-how-how old were you,
first time?

1505
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,446
Thirteen.

1506
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,646
Good Lord, man.

1507
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,727
Whoa!
What?

1508
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,610
Ah, yeah, 13!
Goodness.

1509
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,165
I rest my case.

1510
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,441
You see?
Lord have mercy.

1511
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:42,608
See, Doc-Doc was 18.

1512
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,120
- I was 19.
- 19.

1513
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,680
One year worse than 18.

1514
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,245
- That's not worse.
- It was time.

1515
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,642
No.No, no.
The right time was when I met Mary

1516
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,331
and we committed to each other.
- Oh, what? Come on.

1517
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,121
Look, I-l just want to say that I think
that 13 is still way too young, by the way.

1518
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,929
A-All right. All right,
all right, all right.

1519
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,924
So, anyway, we're in Disneyland.
We're looking.

1520
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,764
There's Tomorrowland.
There's Fantasyland.

1521
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,649
And then we found

1522
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:11,441
one of the most beautiful whorehouses I
have ever seen- And I've seen a lot-

1523
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,090
Uh, I don't, I don't know.

1524
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,446
What?

1525
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,683
I... just... paying for sex,
you know, whores, pimps,

1526
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,127
it's... kind of disgusting.

1527
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,645
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

1528
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,649
Yeah!

1529
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,046
There's my guy!

1530
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,731
Yeah!

1531
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,650
Well, it was, it was okay.
It was nice.

1532
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,802
- Oh!
- Truth be told,

1533
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,120
our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ,

1534
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,690
had not yet entered
into my heart.

1535
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,644
Oh, God, please save me.
And so, I yielded to...

1536
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,006
bad impulses.

1537
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,003
"Yielded."
Do you hear that?

1538
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,650
He "yielded."
That is correct.

1539
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,882
No, I'll tell you
what he did with impulses.

1540
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,167
He drank impulses, right?
- Yes.

1541
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,005
He smoked impulses.
- Yes.

1542
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,202
And he fucked impulses.

1543
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,487
Yes, I confess.
He fucked impulses.

1544
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,324
He was... no, you know
what his nickname is?

1545
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,004
Mueller the Mauler.

1546
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:03,048
He was famous
for the five-dollar,

1547
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,009
five-minute special. Right?
- Yeah.

1548
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,003
I mean, he was
like a jackrabbit.

1549
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,606
"I don't want to
spend any more money there."

1550
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:14,002
Aah!
That's my bad leg, man!

1551
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,003
That's my bad leg. Shit.

1552
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,320
Son of a bitch.

1553
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,600
Come on, man.

1554
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:24,246
I was also famous for whipping
a motherfucker's ass.

1555
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,769
Listen, if was all...

1556
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,207
Seems very funny right now.

1557
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,441
It was funny.

1558
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,842
Yeah, well, it was pure
dereliction of duty, sir.

1559
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,327
Dereliction of duty, pure and simple.
Remember that.

1560
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:44,882
Actually, it... it was like
going to a friend's house.

1561
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,886
And then... then you just...

1562
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,281
then you have sex
with the friend.

1563
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,086
Then what?

1564
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,286
And then...

1565
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,602
...you'd give 'em money.

1566
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,926
Then you'd pay your friend.

1567
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,083
- That's right.
- Oh, I got to tell you,

1568
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,766
we did get tired
of listening to him

1569
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,081
talking about that beautiful
Asian whore of his, right?

1570
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:14,601
- Oh, man-
- SAL: He was so proud-

1571
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,921
He said he had a hard-on so big,

1572
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,327
felt like he was
in a full-body cast.

1573
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,482
It's like nothing can move.

1574
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,251
He couldn't blink and he
couldn't even move his fingers.

1575
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,448
Oh. That's... that's not...

1576
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:28,090
...that's not true.

1577
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,481
Oh, fuck me,
I miss those days...

1578
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,444
when you had a...

1579
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,921
a boner
you could hang a towel on.

1580
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,401
Jesus.

1581
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,605
I used to have a Johnson that would
stand up and watch me shave.

1582
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,842
Oh, like this.
Like, "How you doing?

1583
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,689
"Yeah? You all right?

1584
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,531
How is your day so far?"

1585
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,849
Now... now it watches me
pull up my socks.

1586
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,405
Just like, "All right."

1587
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,010
When it goes, it goes.

1588
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,481
It goes. Goes quickly, too.
- Don't encourage this.

1589
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,369
Don't encourage this, Washington.
- Goes fast.

1590
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,641
Oh, man.

1591
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,484
- Keep using it, though.
- Okay.

1592
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,130
- You don't...
- I'm imagining...

1593
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:16,889
I'm imagining his penis
helping him pick up his socks.

1594
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,291
Just what does that look like?

1595
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,888
I'm home. Huh?

1596
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,971
New York.
New fucking York.

1597
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,730
Well, let's not wander too far.

1598
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,485
No, no, no, just far enough to
find the first Blarney Stone,

1599
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,928
which... I believe is this way.

1600
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,122
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
This way.

1601
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:55,887
Take that in.

1602
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,325
Take a deep breath.

1603
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,006
What, you do it?
What do you smell?

1604
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,084
There's one distinct smell.
What is it?

1605
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,362
Urine. I love it.

1606
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:07,164
It's like the official scent
of the city.

1607
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,242
Huh?

1608
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,683
All right.

1609
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:17,004
♪ Buh-buh-buh-buh-da
Blarney Stone ♪

1610
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:21,005
Barkeep, I will have
one more drink

1611
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:23,441
and then one more after that.

1612
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,081
See, this is what we call a man
with a drinking problem.

1613
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:29,401
This, right here.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1614
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,687
I ain't got no problem.
I got this mastered.

1615
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,969
Born in pain, live in fear,
die alone.

1616
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,447
Could you be any more Irish
right now?

1617
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:40,245
Could you possibly be
any more Irish right now?

1618
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,322
No, I do not think I can be.

1619
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,165
Although, I will confess to you

1620
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,847
my-my mother is
actual! Y half Italian.

1621
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:50,968
I lost one.
He lost two.

1622
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:58,569
Yeah, well, guess
he thought it was worth it.

1623
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:04,042
It's not worth it to me.

1624
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,605
Wonder if it's worth it
for his daughters.

1625
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,286
He's got twins, right?

1626
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,089
Who?
Oh, the cheerleader?

1627
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,321
Who?

1628
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,129
Well...

1629
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,407
He was a cheerleader in college

1630
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:21,403
before he was the president.

1631
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:23,244
Would it be worth their lives?

1632
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,368
Even one of them?

1633
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,283
Doc...

1634
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,761
Look, kid...

1635
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,969
there's no answers in there.

1636
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:36,288
Right? The answers you're
looking for can be found

1637
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,204
in petition and prayer.
Okay. Thank you.

1638
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:42,608
Okay. You guys ready for an adventure?
- Yup.

1639
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,170
Huh? Let's go.
Let's hit it.

1640
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,368
Where are we going?
Uh, it's a secret.

1641
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:47,805
You'll find out
when you get there,

1642
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,609
just like heaven.
- Oh, I don't like the sound of this.

1643
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,125
Just like heaven.

1644
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:58,281
How many minutes
do I get on this again?

1645
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,521
On this plan...
Yeah.

1646
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,483
...500.

1647
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:03,289
Every month?

1648
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,805
Yes.

1649
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,325
Is that enough?

1650
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:08,801
"Enough?"
Yeah.

1651
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,804
How can anybody talk for more
than 500 minutes a month

1652
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,291
on a fucking telephone?
That's a good point.

1653
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,970
Pardon my French.
No, it's a good point.

1654
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:16,530
I mean...
We're going to miss our train

1655
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,329
- as sure as God
made little, green apples.

1656
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:23,361
We're not gonna miss it. Calm down, calm down.
And if you call people with the same plan,

1657
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,090
doesn't count
against your minutes.

1658
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,204
That's-that's one hell of a plan.
- It is.

1659
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:29,725
Well, what do you care
who's on the plan?

1660
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,161
You don't know anybody on the plan.
- I know you two fuckers.

1661
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,651
Come on, let's get some phones.

1662
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,722
I don't want one.
I don't need one.

1663
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,365
Thank you.
I wouldn't mind having one,

1664
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,851
to tell you the truth.
- Hey!

1665
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,002
Oh, Lord.
- I've often thought about it

1666
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:44,448
Barkeep, a round of phones for my partners here.
- Right.

1667
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:47,000
Okay, so he and I can talk
to each other any time,

1668
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,048
even though he's in Norfolk
and I'm in New Hampshire,

1669
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,122
and it's not gonna
cost us anything?

1670
01:24:51,200 --> 01:24:53,202
- That's the deal.
- Wow.

1671
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,805
Don't believe it.
Come on, Mueller.

1672
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,962
What?
- Mueller. Come on.

1673
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,451
With the three-way
calling thing,

1674
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,403
we can talk to each other
at the same time.

1675
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,960
Yeah, but aren't we talking to each
other at the same time right now?

1676
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:05,520
But we'll be on phones.

1677
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,206
All right, what
if I don't like it?

1678
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:11,409
I mean, we get stuck with a contract
for what, a year, two years?

1679
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,720
- Just two years.
- Two years.

1680
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,290
What if you fall down?

1681
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,691
Have you thought of that? Huh?
- Yeah.

1682
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,728
With your gimpy legs,
that's a real possibility.

1683
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,925
What if you fell into a ditch, and you
can't get up and nobody can see you?

1684
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,287
I mean, it is adios, padre.

1685
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:28,371
But, ah, with your mobile
phone, you get it out

1686
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:31,205
and if you can see the numbers,
your glasses are...

1687
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:34,363
like, "Oh, I can't see.
Help me. Help me.

1688
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,209
I've fallen and I can't get up."

1689
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,205
Guys, 911 calls don't count
against your minutes, either.

1690
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:42,402
That's... come on, that's...

1691
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:43,811
All right, all right, all right.
- Yeah!

1692
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,531
If I say yes, will you shut the
hell up so we can get our train?

1693
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,125
I'll shut up.
Okay.

1694
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,322
Yeah!

1695
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,481
Come on!

1696
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,241
Hello.
- Hello. This is God. Is this Reverend Mueller?

1697
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,924
Who's this? Say what?
- God.

1698
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,923
Uh, you're not' gonna get'
info heaven after all.

1699
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,002
What the...?
I'm very displeased with the way

1700
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,684
you're talking about fornicating with whores.
- Who is this?

1701
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,205
I say, who is...
- This is God.

1702
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,446
Wha...
- This is definitely God.

1703
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,285
Hey, hey. Sal. Stop.
- What? This is not Sal. This is God.

1704
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:26,964
Stop it now.
- This is God...

1705
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,883
Burning up my minutes
with that foolishness.

1706
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,282
Wait. You should call John Redman on the train.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1707
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,486
Here.

1708
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:36,689
This will be
my second official call.

1709
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,970
Uh-huh.

1710
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:44,442
By the way, when you call God,
doesn't cost you any minutes.

1711
01:26:44,520 --> 01:26:47,091
He told me.

1712
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,886
Hey, John Redman.

1713
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,843
Guess who this is.

1714
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,002
Yeah.
How'd you know?

1715
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,367
All right, l-listen,
lam calling you

1716
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,967
from my brand-new mobile
cellular cordless telephone.

1717
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:02,566
That you don't even know how to use.
- Hush up.

1718
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:04,808
Listen, I want to give you
my number, all right?

1719
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:07,326
How do you already have it?
I didn't give it to you.

1720
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:09,801
It comes up on his.
- Hey, that's just what he said.

1721
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:11,484
The number comes up
on the screen!

1722
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,846
Can you believe this?

1723
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:14,365
Wow.
Okay, listen up.

1724
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,442
Uh, we are on...

1725
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,921
Huh?
Ah.

1726
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,771
Okay. Okay.

1727
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,291
Yeah. Yeah.

1728
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,930
Okay. All right.

1729
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,530
What's going on?

1730
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,844
They are on their way
to Boston, so...

1731
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,331
The train left without us?
- Yeah.

1732
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:34,686
Outstanding.

1733
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:36,649
Outstanding.
- What?

1734
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:39,849
I warned you, didn't I? Didn't I warn you?
- What does it matter?

1735
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,684
We miss this train,
we'll take the next one, okay?

1736
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,205
There's, like,
a million trains to Boston.

1737
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:45,004
Mm-hmm.
- You know what? You worry too much.

1738
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,730
That's why your hair
went so gray.

1739
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,246
You worry too much.

1740
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,084
This is a boarding call

1741
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,123
for Amtrak Acela Express train 2171

1742
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:54,685
en route to Washington

1743
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:56,524
with intermediate stops
at Newark,

1744
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,206
Philadelphia,
Wilmington, Baltimore...

1745
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,130
We are all set.

1746
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,129
We're on the express
straight to Boston.

1747
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,890
When?
- 7:00 a.m.

1748
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,371
Oh, geez.

1749
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,522
Come on. It's the city
that never sleeps.

1750
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:10,806
Why should we?

1751
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,046
Come on.

1752
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,645
Let's have some fun.

1753
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,728
Now, you take

1754
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,290
the fade-a way jump shot-

1755
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,085
Ooh, wow,
it's a beautiful thing of beauty.

1756
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:22,561
Free throws are what win
or lose a game, though.

1757
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:24,404
Oh, fuck.
That is... they're so boring.

1758
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,881
It's true.
But they're boring.

1759
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,930
It stops all the action
all the time.

1760
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:32,923
And there's way too many
of those fuckin' things.

1761
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,729
You're not supposed
to go in there,

1762
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,486
banging around with a guy,
banging all the time.

1763
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,410
Fouls... no, I'm serious,

1764
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:43,608
fouls...

1765
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,489
should be...

1766
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,764
shameful.

1767
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,444
You know?
Hmm.

1768
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,841
But there's no fuckin' shame
anywhere anymore.

1769
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,327
Look who's talking.

1770
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,765
You ever been ashamed of anything
you've ever done in your life?

1771
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,001
Ever?

1772
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,009
Once.

1773
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,648
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1774
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,927
You know why.

1775
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,004
Did you remember
that Boston was where...

1776
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:17,761
he was from?

1777
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,047
I remember he was from Boston.

1778
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:23,163
So I've been looking into...

1779
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:27,768
seeing if I could find maybe he
still had some... family there.

1780
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,042
- Why?
- 'Cause...

1781
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,366
'Cause he's drunk, that's why.

1782
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,046
What-what does that
got anything to do with it?

1783
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,049
You get like this
every time you drink?

1784
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,690
Pretty much.

1785
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,725
Then you shouldn't drink.

1786
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:43,610
It's what I got instead of God.

1787
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:45,284
Uh-huh, I see.
I understand.

1788
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,289
I got God.
- Yeah.

1789
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,971
Doc did his time.

1790
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,168
You got drunk.

1791
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,691
Yep.

1792
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:55,125
Yeah.

1793
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,527
Maybe he got the better
of the deal.

1794
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,171
He was gonna die anyway, Sal
- No. No.

1795
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:02,730
He didn't have to suffer.

1796
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,569
Not like that.

1797
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,569
- But he did.
- No.

1798
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:08,005
Jimmy Hightower.

1799
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,041
We can't even say his name.

1800
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,849
We all feel guilty about how
he suffered when he was dying,

1801
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:20,684
but did it ever occur to you

1802
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:23,684
that maybe nobody
would have been shot

1803
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,331
and everybody'd still be alive

1804
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:29,922
if we had just been doing
our jobs, not fuckin' around?

1805
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,887
Boarding call for Amtrak Acela
Express train 2150 to Boston

1806
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,240
with no intermediate stops.

1807
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,051
Passengers should proceed to track 23.
- Sal.

1808
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,531
Sal.

1809
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,807
Sal, we gotta go.

1810
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,491
We gotta go.
We gotta get our train.

1811
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:57,921
Mueller.

1812
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,809
Time to go.

1813
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,928
Can I ask you
a personal question?

1814
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:31,922
No.

1815
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,729
Thank you.

1816
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:36,764
Why is it that you married
a black woman?

1817
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,081
Oh, what?

1818
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:43,051
Come on.
It's not like you never had a white woman before.

1819
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,805
I know better.
And it was the '70s and all that.

1820
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:48,326
Which, if I remember rightly,

1821
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,086
was when you white dudes

1822
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,925
admitted to having a thing
for black women.

1823
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,287
I'm gaga for the sisters.

1824
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,681
They dig me, too.

1825
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:00,848
Couple of 'em.

1826
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:02,644
For a time.

1827
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:05,485
First of all, Sal,

1828
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:07,528
who I married
is none of your business.

1829
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:10,968
And that is why
I'm being so polite about it.

1830
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:12,963
Okay, I'll tell you.

1831
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,611
God told me to.

1832
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:19,490
God told you
to marry a black woman?

1833
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,965
No.

1834
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,008
God told me to marry Ruth.

1835
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,287
Hmm.

1836
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,011
How come God don't talk to me?

1837
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,764
Because you don't listen.

1838
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,001
I hear just fine.

1839
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,447
You hear just fine,
but you don't listen.

1840
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:38,850
So you listen, and that's why
He talks to you.

1841
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:40,524
That's not what I said.

1842
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,648
Mm.
I said that God

1843
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,688
told me to marry Ruth,

1844
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,649
to be a good man,

1845
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,643
and to preach the Word.

1846
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,651
So He does talk to you.

1847
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:55,007
He touched my heart.

1848
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,531
Maybe it was Ruth who touched your heart.
- Oh, yes.

1849
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:01,483
It was God through Ruth.

1850
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,086
I was a down-and-out,

1851
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,521
recovering alcoholic
with a shot-up leg,

1852
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,410
and one day...
I found Jesus.

1853
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,323
Where?
Where'd you find Him?

1854
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:14,568
Like, on a street corner
or something?

1855
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,165
No, in my heart, Sal.

1856
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:18,242
The only place
you can truly find Him.

1857
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,722
I went deep inside my own heart
like it was some scary cave,

1858
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,041
some... unexplored place.

1859
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,889
Which it was.

1860
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,851
Went down alone and afraid,
and came back up fearless,

1861
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,890
with Jesus by my side,
and there...

1862
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,367
the very next Sunday,

1863
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,046
took myself to church.

1864
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,124
And there was Ruth?
And there was Ruth.

1865
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:45,086
And everything fell
into place for me.

1866
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,129
That is a beautiful story.

1867
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,402
Sorry the fuck I asked.

1868
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:57,211
So, if God exists...

1869
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,447
I mean, would it kill Him

1870
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,329
to just tap me
on the shoulder or something,

1871
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,329
just shake my hand like a man?

1872
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,243
And, while He's at if,

1873
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:09,244
if He could deliver a nice
black girl with a great ass,

1874
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:10,481
so much the better.

1875
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,681
Hey, hey, hey-

1876
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,728
Lei' me ask you
another question-

1877
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,928
When Ruth was a child,

1878
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,128
was she a Baby Ruth?

1879
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,328
You get... you get it?

1880
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:24,768
- You know what Christmas is for me?
- What?

1881
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,490
A Doc Holiday.

1882
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,051
That's good, Doc.

1883
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,048
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, tha-that's the one.

1884
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:40,441
That's the one we want.

1885
01:34:40,520 --> 01:34:43,410
What do you think he's up to?
- Oh, wheelin' and dealin'.

1886
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:46,370
Mr. Cellular Phone!
- All right. All right. All right, fellas,

1887
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,369
we got an errand to run.
Do we even have time?

1888
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,925
Oh, yeah,
we've got plenty of time.

1889
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,764
I was just on with Redman.
He and Washington

1890
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:54,810
are already in New Hampshire,
so we'll see 'em there.

1891
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,124
I don't know how I lived without this thing.
I really don't.

1892
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,727
Detail! Forward hut!

1893
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,406
I eff. I eff.

1894
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,885
I eff.

1895
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,840
She's been living with if
all these years, anyway.

1896
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,720
What good is it gonna do her?
We are long overdue, the way I figure.

1897
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,843
She ought to know the truth, and we
ought to be men enough to say it.

1898
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,889
How did you even find her?

1899
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,122
I got O'Toole to call
his granddaughter,

1900
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,441
and she looked it up for us
on the World Wide Web.

1901
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,164
What can we possibly say to her?

1902
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:06,083
We say the truth.

1903
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,204
- It's a little bit further.
- And two...

1904
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:12,363
Couple more on the left there.
Right there. There it is.

1905
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:14,363
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh, this-this red...

1906
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:17,091
Yeah-That's if-
- MUELLER: - - - staircase here-

1907
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,448
All right.

1908
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,402
Maybe she's not here.

1909
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:29,404
Hey, we didn't come
all this way...

1910
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:37,245
Mrs. Hightower?
- Yes?

1911
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,084
I'm, uh,
Reverend Richard Mueller.

1912
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,650
I served with your son
in Vietnam.

1913
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:42,842
Oh, yes.
One moment, please.

1914
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,246
Welcome.
- Thank you.

1915
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:50,890
Come on in.

1916
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,724
Hi. Name is Sal.

1917
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,723
Welcome.
- Hi. Larry Sheppard.

1918
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,804
- So glad you could come.
- Thank you, ma'am.

1919
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,321
I'm gonna show you
some pictures.

1920
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,410
This one...

1921
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,601
That's the last one
we ever got from Jimmy.

1922
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:13,006
Look at him.

1923
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,565
Hmm?
Yeah.

1924
01:37:14,680 --> 01:37:16,011
- Remember that smile?
- Sure do.

1925
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,162
- He was a handsome man, wasn't he?
- Yes, he was.

1926
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,805
Oh, Lord have mercy.

1927
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,086
And this

1928
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,889
is his little girl.

1929
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,281
All grown up now.
- My Lord.

1930
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,081
My Lord.

1931
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:33,925
How old was she when he died?

1932
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,480
Four months.

1933
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:41,168
Her mom eventually remarried,
and they moved to San Diego.

1934
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,208
Mm.

1935
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:46,163
And these,

1936
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:48,888
they're my great-g rand.

1937
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,126
Hmm?

1938
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,602
Look at that.

1939
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,085
He'd be a grandfather.

1940
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,482
I never saw them in person,
but they calls.

1941
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:05,847
Mm.
Every now and then.

1942
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:09,323
So...

1943
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,449
you three men
were with my Jimmy.

1944
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:13,646
Yes, ma'am.

1945
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,404
3rd Marine Division.

1946
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,642
We were a very fight unit-

1947
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:19,324
Ma'am.

1948
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:21,368
It's like this.

1949
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,568
Uh, see“.

1950
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:27,328
We had already fought us

1951
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,402
a good long year,

1952
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,489
and most of us

1953
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:34,642
were still breathing.

1954
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:39,965
But the extension...

1955
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:44,003
that... that four months
they added on,

1956
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,491
that was...

1957
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:48,651
that was bad.

1958
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,848
And...

1959
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:52,922
some of us...

1960
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,247
we just couldn't handle it, see,

1961
01:38:55,320 --> 01:38:59,041
and, uh, I-I don't
even think that, uh...

1962
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:01,208
What was it for?

1963
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,611
Hmm?

1964
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,604
What was it all for?

1965
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,927
Right, well...

1966
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,964
they said they knew,
and we just believed them.

1967
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,367
But now...

1968
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,051
Mrs. Hightower,

1969
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,283
we came here today
to tell you what happened.

1970
01:39:29,960 --> 01:39:31,803
Were you...

1971
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,247
...were you some of the men
he saved?

1972
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:39,651
I mean...

1973
01:39:39,760 --> 01:39:42,889
were you some of the men

1974
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,450
whose lives Jimmy saved?

1975
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:46,568
I mean, they told me
that he saved

1976
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:49,086
three or four of his buddies
before he was killed.

1977
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:53,011
Were you?

1978
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,088
Were you?

1979
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,889
Yes, ma'am, that was us.

1980
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:07,008
Jimmy was...

1981
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,650
a great guy.

1982
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:12,166
Yep.
Never forget him.

1983
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:15,842
That's why we're here, ma'am.

1984
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,406
Uh, we feel we owe him.

1985
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,448
Yeah.

1986
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,763
We just wanted to come by
to pay our respects.

1987
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,286
And, you know,
let you know

1988
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:30,842
that he's always been
in our hearts.

1989
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,323
God bless you.

1990
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,441
I can never thank you enough.

1991
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,891
Mrs. Hightower,

1992
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,201
very glad to have met you.

1993
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,322
Me, too, son.
Me, too.

1994
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,482
Thank you, ma'am.
- Take care.

1995
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,324
Bye.

1996
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,442
Bless you, Mrs. Hightower.

1997
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,486
Uh...

1998
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:57,926
looks like they used
to make things here.

1999
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,684
Used to.

2000
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,049
That's the operative word,
"used to."

2001
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:10,849
Jesus, I got to piss.

2002
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:37,208
Ah...

2003
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,009
Ah...

2004
01:42:41,120 --> 01:42:43,202
Ha-ha.

2005
01:42:43,280 --> 01:42:44,486
Oh...

2006
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,126
Hey, Mueller.
- Yeah?

2007
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,964
Now I see God.

2008
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:53,286
Sal, if you had any more
manners you'd be a dog.

2009
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,524
You gonna want
to stay on here alone?

2010
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,924
Well, I hadn't really
thought much about it.

2011
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:19,083
Portsmouth. Boy.

2012
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,087
With the brig right there.

2013
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,531
Might want to try another place.

2014
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,206
Fresh start.

2015
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,362
But Larry'll be here.

2016
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:33,930
Mary, too.

2017
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:36,520
You could always visit.

2018
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,400
Hey.

2019
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:41,608
You got close friends here?

2020
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,403
Not too many.

2021
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:48,846
Not too close.

2022
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,724
Move to Norfolk.

2023
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:56,371
You can work in my bar.

2024
01:44:56,440 --> 01:45:00,604
I don't know anything
about working in bars, Sal.

2025
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:04,127
Trust me, you don't need
to know much.

2026
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,641
Well, your bar
doesn't seem that busy.

2027
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:08,683
No, it ain't.

2028
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,489
But that's my fault, see?

2029
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,285
I let it go.

2030
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:15,288
It just needs some...

2031
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:17,926
new blood, you know?

2032
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:21,807
We can get the grill part
going again, boy.

2033
01:45:23,640 --> 01:45:26,166
I need a partner.

2034
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:28,282
A partner?
- Yeah.

2035
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,687
The bar would be half yours.

2036
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,009
Then, when I bite it,
it'd be all yours.

2037
01:45:34,120 --> 01:45:35,485
Sal, you don't owe me anything.

2038
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:37,768
No, no, hey, this has nothing
to do with, you know,

2039
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:39,126
paying back a debt.

2040
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,646
Trust me.

2041
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:44,485
I really do need a partner.

2042
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:50,771
You could stay with me.

2043
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,241
For a while. Then you'd
have to get your own place,

2044
01:45:53,360 --> 01:45:57,126
'cause I like to pursue the ladies,
if you know what I mean.

2045
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:01,888
And quite frankly, no offense,
but you'd cramp my style, Doc.

2046
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:11,009
You thinking about it?

2047
01:46:11,080 --> 01:46:13,970
I am.
I'm picturing it.

2048
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:16,361
It's kind of funny.

2049
01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:18,323
Yeah.

2050
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:23,050
Might be time for a new BOD
in your life, huh?

2051
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:26,403
Better career decision.
There you go.

2052
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,366
If nothing else, I guarantee it,

2053
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,250
we'd have some fun.

2054
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,364
What's wrong with that?

2055
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,648
You are in love with that thing.

2056
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:46,408
Look at you, you can't even put it down.
- No, I'm trying to get that fucker O'Toole to answer.

2057
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:49,649
You know, the whole place
could be burned down for all I know.

2058
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:51,245
Come on, you dick.

2059
01:46:56,800 --> 01:46:58,848
Well,

2060
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:01,082
there it is,
Larry's graduation suit.

2061
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,843
- Oh, that's nice.
- Very nice, Doc.

2062
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,126
Looks a little small.

2063
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,726
You think?
- Yes, sir.

2064
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,723
Larry bulked up,

2065
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:14,007
so that might be
a little tight on him now.

2066
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:16,400
Oh, okay.
Well, I guess

2067
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:19,250
I could go down to Penney's
and get him something new.

2068
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:22,324
Well, we do still have
his dress blues.

2069
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:25,051
Oh, my word.

2070
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:27,248
The dress blue uniform.

2071
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,209
Remember how we used to call it?
The tuxedo.

2072
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:31,248
The tuxedo. Yeah.Yeah.

2073
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,607
'Cause by law, you could wear
it to any formal function.

2074
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:36,200
Not that we ever
got invited to one,

2075
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,328
or would have gone
even if we had.

2076
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,449
Still, it was nice to know
you were always dressed

2077
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:43,329
for any occasion.

2078
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,802
That's true, and e men
never forgets the first time

2079
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,484
he puts on that uniform,
let me tell you.

2080
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:49,931
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- Huh?

2081
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,445
Didn't you stand in front

2082
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,891
of the mirror
looking at yourself?

2083
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,610
Right?
Ooh!

2084
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:58,401
I am in the United States Marine
Corps, and I look pretty fucking good-

2085
01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:00,881
I remember loving that feeling.

2086
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,406
Yes, sir.
Glad to know that never changes.

2087
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:06,723
Ooh, I bet Larry looked sharp
in his, didn't he?

2088
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:09,610
Oh, he did.
Yeah, he was proud as a peacock in it.

2089
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:11,569
Mm.
I know that for a fact, sir.

2090
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,242
You know,
and that's the point, Doc.

2091
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:17,129
It's about pride.

2092
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,531
And it's not a sin.

2093
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:22,207
Oh, no, not that kind
of pride, no, sir.

2094
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:23,964
I guess I could...

2095
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,527
bury him in his uniform,
even if...

2096
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,529
Yeah, you could.

2097
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,682
Yeah.
Means you did something.

2098
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:32,761
You know, you served.

2099
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,810
Fuck what the politicians did.
You served.

2100
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,486
Right?
You didn't try to weasel out of it,

2101
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,767
- or think it was somebody else's job.
- Nope.

2102
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:43,923
You took it on, man,
and you looked sharp doing it.

2103
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,082
Like a man.

2104
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:51,530
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
bury him in his uniform.

2105
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,890
- That's good, Doc.
- Mmm.

2106
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,162
Never regret it, sir.

2107
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,289
- Fuckin' A.
- Okay.

2108
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:09,328
Hey.
Washington.

2109
01:49:09,400 --> 01:49:11,971
You ever relax, huh?
Why don't you sit down?

2110
01:49:16,240 --> 01:49:18,686
That's it, huh?

2111
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,207
Okay.
Yeah, much better.

2112
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:48,407
Why are you looking
at me like that?

2113
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,168
I'm sizing you up.

2114
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:56,048
You know what?

2115
01:49:56,120 --> 01:50:00,170
I am gonna get you
a new suit of clothes.

2116
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,521
Say what?
- Yup.

2117
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,080
I'm gonna dress you up
for the occasion.

2118
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:07,004
May I ask why?

2119
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:10,567
Well... because I love you.

2120
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:14,807
Hey. Mm-hmm.

2121
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,929
First of all, uh, I don't need
a new suit of clothes.

2122
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,765
Yeah.
Second of all,

2123
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:29,401
you're the one who could
really use some grooming.

2124
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:33,201
And third of all, neither one
of us are dressed properly.

2125
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,089
But we're gonna be.
You watch.

2126
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,481
Oh, the things that come into
your head and out of your mouth.

2127
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:40,410
Scary, right?

2128
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,801
You know what I think?

2129
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:45,929
I think that "I love you" thing really
rattled you, didn't it old man?

2130
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,002

Doc, I don't know

2151
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:52,926
or how much the president
regrets your loss and all that,

2152
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,283
but... here it is.

2153
01:52:58,240 --> 01:52:59,924
Your country's flag.

2154
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:03,647
Thank you.

2155
01:53:05,080 --> 01:53:07,447
You put that somewhere
and let it remind you

2156
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,688
of what was in your son's heart.

2157
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:47,366
We don't know...
I know. It's...

2158
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:49,283
Well, once you're a marine,

2159
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:50,964
you're always a marine.

2160
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,407
And even though I'm no longer
on active duty...

2161
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:55,084
But if I was...
- Yeah.

2162
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,970
...I ask you, you see
a man in this uniform?

2163
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,088
Huh?
Could you resist all this?

2164
01:54:00,160 --> 01:54:01,924
Huh?
I, um...

2165
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,526
No, I...
I don't think I could.

2166
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,601
Mm-hmm.

2167
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:07,842
It's the uniform,
or the man in the uniform?

2168
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:11,407
It's a killer combination.
- It's the combination. Isn't it?

2169
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,720
Kind of seductive.

2170
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,211
Thank you.
- Yeah.

2171
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,926
You are a very perceptive
young lady.

2172
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:29,130
We all wrote one.

2173
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:34,606
I gave mine to Larry,
and he gave his to me.

2174
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,126
What does it say?

2175
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:47,966
I-I don't know, Mr. Sheppard.

2176
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:52,167
Hmm.

2177
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:54,123
Okay.

2178
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:21,245
I'm just saying,
when you think about it,

2179
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:23,761
a young man is struggling
out of the gate,

2180
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:26,531
goes on a date, has to
borrow his dad's car,

2181
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:28,364
- needs to borrow a couple bucks.
- WOMAN Yes-

2182
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,005
Whereas, an older,
established gentlemen

2183
01:55:30,080 --> 01:55:32,242
doesn't have to do any of that, right?
- Sal?

2184
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,362
No...
- I need you to come with me right now.

2185
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:36,090
Can you see I'm a little busy?
- I can.

2186
01:55:36,160 --> 01:55:39,687
I'm gonna have to borrow him for a few minutes right now.
- Does this have to happen right now?

2187
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,001
Right now. Doc needs us.
Double quick, son.

2188
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:43,884
I'll be right back.
- Okay. Yeah.

2189
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:45,530
We'll pick this up. Okay.
- Yeah.

2190
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,444
Bye, Sarge.

2191
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,441
You all right?

2192
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,170
You got to open it, Doc.

2193
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:20,246
He wanted you to have it.

2194
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,040
Hmm.

2195
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:40,970
Dear Dad,

2196
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,241
if you are reading this,
then you've been notified.

2197
01:56:43,320 --> 01:56:44,970
I was always prepared

2198
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,611
to sacrifice my life
for my country.

2199
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:50,763
You have to be ready to die
defending what you love.

2200
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:52,524
I need you to understand

2201
01:56:52,640 --> 01:56:54,802
that I am honored
to die in this way.

2202
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:57,326
Don't feel bad
that my life was so short.

2203
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,448
It was a good life.

2204
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,569
I know you never wanted me
to join the Marines,

2205
01:57:02,640 --> 01:57:04,927
but you supported me even so.

2206
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,607
I had the greatest father,
and I love you.

2207
01:57:08,680 --> 01:57:10,603
Now I am with Mom.

2208
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:13,126
We will both watch over you.

2209
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:17,091
Dad, I want you to bury me
in my uniform next to Mom.

2210
01:57:18,160 --> 01:57:21,528
Your loving son, Larry.

2211
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:31,366
